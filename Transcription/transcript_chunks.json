She says for too long we have treated nationality and citizenship casually and as interchangeable concepts, unwilling to confront the deeper cultural issues. I said years ago that multiculturalism had failed. We are now living in the wreckage of that failure. Our identity crisis is the result of decades of neglect, complacency and cowardice.
