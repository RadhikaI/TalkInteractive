 really there's a message being conveyed that aid is supposed to be in the US national interest which was not really the policy under the Biden administration so that that is being used a criteria but that's obviously a difficult. But it depends how you define national interest doesn't it because you know people who work for the Biden administration people at USAID that I've spoken to would say actually to have Americans you know sought out irrigation systems in Africa or schooling programs in Southeast Asia you know or I don't know water pipelines in eastern Ukraine we're still under Ukrainian occupation that is that is American soft power that is a good side of America to show to the rest of the world and it takes and it brings dividends.
