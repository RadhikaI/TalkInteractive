 So it's just because it's part of your routine because people listening will be saying I haven't got the time, I haven't got the energy, you know this woman probably doesn't work. I know you do. I know you do. I was just setting it up for a little bit of a dramatic tension on the radio. So how do you account for the fact that you can find the time and the energy to do this when many people claim that they can't? Yeah and I totally understand for a lot of people it's so much easier and sometimes cheaper as well to actually just grab food from the side and I totally get that. For me I suppose it's the way I was raised. I was always raised with home cooked food and so it was the norm for me when I had my boys that obviously I have to make home cooked food whether I'm working, whether I'm running a business.
