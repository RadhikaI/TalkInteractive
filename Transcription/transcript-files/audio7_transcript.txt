 nicknames for the most obviously overweight lads. It wasn't a massive curse, it didn't involve bullying largely because of rugby and they were very good on the rugby pitch, quite often the big lads, not least when you sort of, if they hit puberty early, you could just say give it to Keith, give it to Keith and Keith would then just wade through school children as a sort of little mini-man in waiting and if he was a couple of stone overweight as well, he'd be like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, a couple of stone overweight as well, then the kids would fall over even more. Even Keith is a surname in this context, obviously at my prep school, like Penelope Keith or John Key. But that's not true anymore. I mean now at some school...
