 I'm cooler, but I'm your big fan. What do you mean you're my big fan? I may have more than one big fan. I hope I do. I hope you do. But for now you're the only one I need, Ayesha. What would you like to say? OK, so I'm just basing it on my children. I've got two boys, 23 and 15. They've always been very slim. Right. The reason why I feel they're very slim, I think there's a number of reasons. One of the biggest ones is home cooked food. I do cook every single day. They have, even like the 15 year old, when he comes back from school, he'll have a proper meal. And then he'll have dinner as well at half seven. Gosh. So we mostly have home cooked food. We do have takeout, but it's not on a regular basis, not even once a week. Once in a while, yeah.
