 To get that sense of vibrancy around something that is easy to access, that is cheap, that you can make very tasty, we need to make it cool, can we come and do some stuff with mob? Yes. With broccoli. Absolutely. You can come and cook billions of tons of broccoli with us. Would I have to, because I've seen your stuff and it is very cool, would I have to grow a little moustache and wear round glasses and have a beanie hat or something? Yeah, I think the outfit you're wearing right now is very cool, but just come like that. My stylist will be delighted. Thank you so much for coming in. It's terrific to meet you. Honestly, go and look at their stuff. It is amazing. If you go and check out mob, though I have a website, you've got an app, I think, as well that you can download. Yeah, exactly, the app store. Go and find it, because it is really good stuff. We're very grateful to you for coming in and for your involvement. Ben Liebers, the CEO and the CEO of the Mob.
