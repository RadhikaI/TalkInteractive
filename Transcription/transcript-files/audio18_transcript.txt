 it is 17 minutes after 12 and you are listening to James O'Brien on LBC. The problem with this is it becomes a potentially a battleground with smug parents lining up on one side to explain why their children aren't overweight and beleaguered parents lining up on the other to explain why theirs are. So I suppose in some ways what the ideal would be, the mother of identical twins, one of whom weighed three stone more than the other and then we could try to work as some of it is genetic, obviously. I used to be a little bit dismissive of that claim but you know it's true, you know people whose metabolism are like nuclear powered. They can eat a horse every day and not put a pound on and then other people, like a moment on the lips, a lifetime on the lips.
