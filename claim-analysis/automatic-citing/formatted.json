While it is true that a significant portion of Anglicans live outside England, the specific percentage of regular churchgoers not in England is not directly addressed in the available sources. However, it is noted that only about 33% of Anglicans live in Britain, which includes England, suggesting a majority of Anglicans are outside Britain[5]. Additionally, the Anglican Communion is a global community with members in over 165 countries, indicating a widespread presence beyond England[2][3].",
