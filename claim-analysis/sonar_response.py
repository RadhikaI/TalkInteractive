JW: Thanks Anthea! A: Well, you can't change who you are, that's not your fault, but I know your heart, I know a little bit about it. JW: Well, Anthea, you're really great, and I'm so pleased you asked the question. Yes, 98% of members of the Anglican community who are regular churchgoers are not in England. The average Anglian is an African woman in her thirties; a sub-Saharan African woman in her thirties. And we need to remember that, and I've spent my life being reminded of that. I came to faith in Christ myself partly as a result of the witness of the church in Africa, when I was living in Kenya in 1974.
