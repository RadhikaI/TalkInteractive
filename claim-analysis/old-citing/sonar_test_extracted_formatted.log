His first attempt was in the 1994 Eastleigh by-election, and he continued to stand in various elections until he was finally elected in 2024 for the constituency of Clacton-on-Sea[1][3][5]. There is no record of him standing for re-election three times, as his first successful election was in 2024, and there have been no subsequent re-elections reported."},
