Nigel Farage has stood for election to the UK Parliament eight times, including his successful bid in 2024, but there is no specific mention of him standing for re-election three times[1][3]. Re-election implies that he was already a sitting MP, which was not the case until his 2024 victory.",

In singles sales, Cliff Richard is among the top sellers, but David Bowie is not listed as high as Cliff Richard or The Beatles[2][3][4].
