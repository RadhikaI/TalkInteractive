This assertion by Donald Trump seems to downplay the severity of Russia's actions and overlooks the international condemnation of such aggressive military tactics. The ongoing strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure and civilian areas are widely viewed as a deliberate strategy to harm ordinary Ukrainians and disrupt the country's ability to function, rather than a typical response to a conflict situation[1][2]. Furthermore, Trump's stance has been criticized for aligning with Putin's interests and undermining Ukraine's position in the conflict[3].",

However, this does not necessarily mean that all corporate leaders are indifferent to these issues. In other contexts, such as social media, CEOs have faced criticism and acknowledged shortcomings in protecting users, but they have also taken steps to address these concerns[4].

        "perplexity_response": "The claim that commercial BRCA gene tests can result in as many as 96% false positives, leading to significant emotional distress and a high rate of preventive mastectomies, is **not supported** by the available evidence. The BRCA gene tests are designed to identify harmful mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer[1][2]. While there are concerns about the emotional impact of positive results and the potential for uncertain results (variants of uncertain significance), there is no evidence to suggest that these tests produce false positives at such a high rate[4]. Additionally, the decision to undergo preventive mastectomy is typically made after thorough counseling and consideration of the individual's risk factors, not solely based on a false positive result[1][2].",
