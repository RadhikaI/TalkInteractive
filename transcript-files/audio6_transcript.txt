 at this moment in mid February, do you fear that we are quite close to a Munich 2 moment? Yes, but maybe it's a slower moving one because, you know, Russia doesn't really have the capacity right to go on from like a Munich-like agreement and invade Poland and then invade France. He just doesn't have the capacity to do it. But what I'm afraid of is that Donald Trump is going to reach down and help.
