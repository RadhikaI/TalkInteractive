 and seeing the guy that came out, the hostage that came out and kissed the head of the soldier, who's told to do that. And does that justify holding on to these people? It's incredible. Donald Trump has no, I imagine, emotional link with the Middle East, his latest intervention, positive or negative. Claudine? Well, for me, of course, it's positive, but there is definitely going to be a negative side to that because we don't know what will happen to the current hostages that are still alive. Claudine, I'm glad you got on the radio. I'm sorry that it was anger that drove you to make the call, but I've enjoyed speaking with you. Thank you for your input. Coming up after you, as you may recall, we covered the story about the huge amount of untreated sewage.
