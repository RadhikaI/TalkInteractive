 There shouldn't be hostages in the first place. I mean... They would argue, Claudine, there shouldn't be the number of Palestinians who are held in Israeli jails as well, is what they would argue. They would argue that many of them are prisoners who have committed a trocious crime. I agree with some of children. Well, I don't know enough to comment on that at all, as do most people. But listening to these probably Anglo-Saxon people who have no emotional link to anything that's going on in the Middle East, you know, how they can justify... How they can...or try to justify the holding of hostages, the beating of hostages, the starving of hostages.
