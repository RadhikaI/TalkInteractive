" hermeneed to attack human rights. I think it goes back to your colleague answer, which is it goes back to money. Because when people tell you that we're going to give the human right back to the European Court of Human Law, then they're going to save some money through that. In mind you, we say that we talk about human rights, but we have to remember when we try to get a lawyer, all the lawyers were too expensive for us to pay. So it means if you don't have enough money, you don't have access to human right, you see, and only those cheap advocacy or what you call them people have the right to his free lawyers, I forgot what legal aid, all of those, all of those, they don't work. As soon as you tell them your case, they say, sorry, sorry, sorry. So just to let you know that human right, they cost money and not everybody has access to human right. I think the flip of that is people will say, well, irregular migration costs the UK money, billions, billions of pounds. So we've got a flow of money on both sides of the argument. Well, you're very clever, Matthew. You're absolutely right. But the thing is, I think some politicians, they don't go as deep as trying to solve a problem. So they have this superficial way of solving something. So they say, look, immigration is not the right thing for us. What can we do to make immigration harder? And they start doing things. And one of the things they did is to shift the human right to the European court of justice. And I think that's the simplistic way of doing it. But I just wanted to say, Matthew, you know, I don't have the privilege to listen to you every Sunday because I only do when I work extra hours and I end up listening to you"
