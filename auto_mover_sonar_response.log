This assertion by Donald Trump seems to downplay the severity of Russia's actions and overlooks the international condemnation of such aggressive military tactics. The ongoing strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure and civilian areas are widely viewed as a deliberate strategy to harm ordinary Ukrainians and disrupt the country's ability to function, rather than a typical response to a conflict situation[1][2]. Furthermore, Trump's stance has been criticized for aligning with Putin's interests and undermining Ukraine's position in the conflict[3].\n\n## Evidence Mapping\n- [1]: \"Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,\" Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on social media.\n- [2]: \"Last night, the Russian army fired two ballistic missiles at the center of Dobropillya,\" Zelenskyy said. \"After emergency services arrived at the scene, they launched another strike, deliberately targeting rescuers. It is a vile and inhumane intimidation tactic to which the Russians often resort.\"\n- [3]: \"In recent days, Trump has promoted Moscow\u2019s horrendously false talking points, excoriating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \u201cdictator\u201d and blaming Ukraine for the brutal war that Putin"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}

While there are instances where corporate actions or inactions have led to significant harm, attributing this to a lack of care is not universally accurate. For example, in Bangladesh, labor leaders have criticized multinational corporations for not doing enough to prevent workplace disasters, suggesting a level of responsibility for harm[2]. However, this does not necessarily mean that all corporate leaders are indifferent to these issues. In other contexts, such as social media, CEOs have faced criticism and acknowledged shortcomings in protecting users, but they have also taken steps to address these concerns[4]. Therefore, the claim oversimplifies the complex motivations and actions of corporate leaders.\n\n## Evidence Mapping\n- [2]: \"Of course All these companies have blood on their hands.
