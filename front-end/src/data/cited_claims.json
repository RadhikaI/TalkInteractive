This assertion by Donald Trump seems to downplay the severity of Russia's actions and overlooks the international condemnation of such aggressive military tactics. The ongoing strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure and civilian areas are widely viewed as a deliberate strategy to harm ordinary Ukrainians and disrupt the country's ability to function, rather than a typical response to a conflict situation[1][2]. Furthermore, Trump's stance has been criticized for aligning with Putin's interests and undermining Ukraine's position in the conflict[3].",

However, this does not necessarily mean that all corporate leaders are indifferent to these issues. In other contexts, such as social media, CEOs have faced criticism and acknowledged shortcomings in protecting users, but they have also taken steps to address these concerns[4].

While there is no direct evidence that Farage is currently causing division within a specific party he leads, there are indications of internal conflicts within Reform UK. For instance, there have been criticisms and disagreements within the party, such as the recent row involving MP Rupert Lowe, who criticized Farage's leadership style, suggesting that Reform remains a \"protest party\" under Farage[5]. Additionally, Farage's return to leadership in 2024 and his significant influence over the party could contribute to internal tensions[3].
