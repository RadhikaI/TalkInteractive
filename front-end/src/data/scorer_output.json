        "perplexity_response": "The claim is partially supported. It suggests that without key figures like Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish independence may not progress significantly. This is supported by the fact that both Salmond and Sturgeon were pivotal in the independence movement, with Salmond leading the 2014 referendum and Sturgeon succeeding him as SNP leader and continuing the push for independence[3][5]. However, the claim that independence won't happen for a long time without these figures is speculative and not directly supported by evidence. The Scottish independence movement continues, with other figures and parties involved, such as the Alba Party led by Salmond until his death[1][5].",

Recent surveys indicate that support for Scottish independence and remaining in the UK is roughly evenly divided, with slight variations depending on the poll. For instance, a YouGov survey found that 56% of Scots would vote 'No' to independence, while 44% would vote 'Yes' [2][3].
