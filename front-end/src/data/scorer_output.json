        "perplexity_response": "The claim that sales of children's comics and graphic novels in Britain have reached an all-time peak of almost \u00a320 million is **supported**. The evidence comes from the London Book Fair 2025, which highlights that British kids are buying or having bought for them a record \u00a320 million worth of comics annually[1]. This indicates a significant rise in the sales of graphic novels for both children and adults, likely boosted by screen adaptations and the popularity of manga[1].",

        "perplexity_response": "The claim that \u00a320 million is being made in Britain from the selling of books made of paper is not supported by the available data. The total revenue for the UK publishing industry in 2023 was \u00a37.1 billion, with print revenue reaching \u00a31.9 billion, which includes both paper-based and possibly other formats[1][3]. However, there is no specific mention of \u00a320 million being made from paper-based books alone. The figures provided indicate significant revenue from print sales, but they do not isolate earnings specifically from paper-based books to the tune of \u00a320 million.",
