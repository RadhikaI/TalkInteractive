 The makeshift table from McDonald's. Serve from 11 a.m. subject to availability. I've had a few. Jimmy was my first. He was gorgeous and gave me so much space. Then there was Lorenzo, who was exciting, but also reliable. Elvis is my latest. I love him the most. He makes me feel so warm with his heated seats and steering wheel. It might sound strange to love a car and name them, but it's not just me. But it has to be all Platz on his basic gesture.
